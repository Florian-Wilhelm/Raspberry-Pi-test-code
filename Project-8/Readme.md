# Ambient Light Measurement

## Description

Ambient light measurement with TSL25911 sensor.

## Test Code

Just a raw output in decimal format is provided on either OLED display and on the serial port (High Byte and Low Byte CH0 and CH1, 8-bit is 0..255).

## Hardware

See "connections.h" file for used pins and controllers. I've created the PCB originally for the burglar detection project.
